Jekyll Material Design 
======================

Publish your static website/blog on GitHub Pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) with a *"materialized"* style.

This project is based on [Jekyll-Bootrap-3](https://github.com/dbtek/jekyll-bootstrap-3). It also includes the [Paper theme](http://bootswatch.com/paper) from [Bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com).

## Usage

### 1. Create a Repo
- Go to <https://github.com> and create a new repository named *USERNAME.github.io*  

### 2. Install Jekyll-Bootstrap-3  
<pre>
  <code>
    $ git clone https://github.com/sentenza/jekyll-material-design USERNAME.github.io
    $ cd USERNAME.github.io
    $ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io.git
    $ git push origin master  
  </code>
</pre> 

### 3. Edit your website configuration

Edit `_includes/themes/bootstrap/` to change information about your new website and also to remove the GitHub red ribbon ([default.html#26](https://github.com/sentenza/jekyll-material-design/blob/master/_includes/themes/bootstrap/default.html#L26)).

Please, take a look at [Jekyll intro](http://sentenza.github.io/jekyll-material-design/lessons/2014/02/10/jekyll-intro) to understand how GitHub and Jekyll work together to serve your pages.

### 4. Testing your website locally

To construct and test your site locally, go into the directory and
type

    jekyll build

This will create (or modify) a `_site/` directory, containing
everything from `assets/`, and then the `index.md` and all
`pages/*.md` files, converted to html. (So there'll be
`_site/index.html` and the various `_site/pages/*.html`.)

Type the following in order to &ldquo;serve&rdquo; the site.
This will first run `build`, and so it does _not_ need to be
preceded by `jekyll build`.

    jekyll serve

To make jekyll automatically re-build your changes you can also add the `--watch` option:

    jekyll serve --watch

Now open your browser and go to <http://localhost:4000>.

Read the complete tutorial on <http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/>.

### 4. Enjoy !
- After giving 10 mins to GitHub of course.
